# 10k-Stock-Allocation
This project takes in clean 10-k reports and uses vector embeddings to upload these into a vector database. This model has an agent with 3 tools, one to query the vector database, one to perform online searches and one to retrieve information from a SQL database which represent a stock allocation portfolio.
